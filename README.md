# Mobile Application for WGU University - Concept

A multiple-screen mobile application for WGU students to track their academic terms, courses associated with each term, and assessments associated with each course. 
The application allows students to enter, edit, and delete a term, course, and assessment data. It provides a summary and detailed views of courses for each term, 
provides notifications for upcoming performance and objective assessments, and notifies students of deadlines and tracking milestones even after the application 
is closed. A wireframe has also been created as a visual guide, representing the skeletal framework of the application. The application uses an SQLite database.
